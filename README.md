# Wally Zapotoczny's GitHub Portfolio Website

The website has four main areas, which can also be accessed by a top navigation bar:

1) INTRO - lists my full name and area of occupation.

2) ABOUT ME - this is where I talk about my personal and professional life, accomplishments thus far, and my IT career.

3) PORTFOLIO - this is where I am showcasing three Javascript applications that I have written: Timer App, Colors App, and Sports Teams App. <br>
  a) Timer App - launches a timer with buttons to control when the timer clock starts, stops, and resets to zero. <br>
  b) Colors App - launches a button that allows the user to perform a simple background color change. <br>
  c) Sports Teams App - launches a button that allows the user to change the topic to one of three sports types, which features team logos and varying background colors. <br>  
4) CONTACT ME - this is where my location can be viewed as well as an embedded Google form for contact inquiries to be made.
